                <div id="testimonials">

                    <p>"Nick Finck is an information architecture toreador. He has the ability to tame even the most bellowing projects-ones with tight deadlines, irrational stakeholders, and disturbing user experiences-to deliver an experience that just works. And the best part is that if you egg him on, he'll even show up to a meeting in a matador outfit."
                        <span><strong>&mdash;Nishant Kothary</strong>, <a href="http://visitmix.com">Microsoft MIX Online</a></span>
                    </p>

                    <p>"Digital Web Magazine has been one of the prime sources of information for Web designers. Nick Finck has made sure that DW has kept this position by being a great writer who can explain complicated things simply, an excellent editor-in-chief and an inspiration for countless other designers."
                        <span><strong>&mdash;Peter-Paul Koch</strong>, <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org">Freelancer</a></span>
                    </p>

                    <p>"Nick has to be one of the most connected and influential people I know. From organizing events like WebVisions to being being the publisher of Digital Web Magazine, he puts a lot of his time into creating resources that bring people together and help them become better at their work — and he does it without asking for anything in return."
                        <span><strong>&mdash;Lee LeFever</strong>, <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com">Common Craft</a></span>
                    </p>

                    <p>"Nick is a very skilled information architect whose ability to quickly grasp the desired “end-state” and translate that into site maps, workflows and page descriptions was very impressive. I found him to be intelligent, concise, collaborative and accommodating… allowing us to create a vision together instead of working in silos."
                        <span><strong>&mdash;Chris Westall</strong>, <a href="http://www.art.com">Art.com</a></span>
                    </p>

                    <p>"The quality and longevity of Digital Web Magazine clearly shows Nick’s ability to create and manage – working with a large, disparate team, to tight deadlines, producing quality output and keeping it all running for, literally, years."
                        <span><strong>&mdash;Cal Henderson</strong>, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></span>
                    </p>

                    <p>"I highly recommend Nick, he brings extensive experience and a rich skill set. He can ramp-up into even highly complex projects faster than most, and knows when to ask the right questions. His work ethic and dedication require no second-guessing."
